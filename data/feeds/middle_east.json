Spending on government salaries and commodity subsidies accounts for a large share of oil revenues, putting pressure on the government to realign priorities amid oil price volatility. This dynamic opens the door to new taxes and adjustments to public services, such as education and health care, to ensure the sustainability of the economic model. The draft budget for the 2025–2026 fiscal year forecasts an 11.9% increase in the deficit to 6.31 billion Kuwaiti dinars (about $20.5 billion), driven by an expected decline in oil revenues despite attempts to reduce current spending.

Al-Maliki stated that the next government should be civilian rather than military in nature, adding that participation would be conditional on armed groups relinquishing their weapons. He said some factions had expressed readiness to hand over their arms in order to avoid exposing Iraq to risks. He stressed the need for weapons to be held exclusively by the state, under a single central authority, and called for a unified army operating under state command.

The Bank stressed that the highest legitimate US dollar denomination is $100. \"Black dollar\" scams, in which black-coated paper cut to the size of $100 bills is falsely claimed to be genuine currency that can be restored by removing the coating.
