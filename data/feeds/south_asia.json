The Metropolitan Police said Caspar San Giorgio, 38, of no fixed address, was charged early on Saturday, some 24 hours after his arrest.

In response, Iran targeted Israel and US bases in the Middle East. Explosions were reported in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar. According to the spokesperson, PIA&rsquo;s flights to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Doha and Kuwait have been temporarily suspended.

Addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Volker Turk slammed “social systems that silence women and girls” and allow powerful men to abuse them with impunity. “Violence against women, including femicide, is a global emergency,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights told the UN’s top rights body. He highlighted the extreme situation in Afghanistan, warning that the “system of segregation imposed on women is reminiscent of apartheid, based on gender rather than race”. He also pointed to two cases that have recently caused shock waves around the world: those of convicted Epstein and of French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot. Both cases “show the extent of the exploitation and abuse of women and girls”, Turk said, asking: “does anyone think there are not many more men like Do...",

The index had plunged as much as 3,081 points intra-day after reports that Pakistan targeted terrorist outfits and their logistical support bases in Afghanistan, before trimming losses later in the day. Heavyweight stocks, particularly United Bank, Fauji Fertiliser, Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum and MCB Bank, drove the bulk of the decline, cumulatively shaving 658 points off the index. At the close of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index posted a decline of 830.92 points, or 0.49%, and settled at 168,062.17. Topline Securities, in its market review, noted that the KSE-100 opened on a negative note and declined to the intra-day low of -3,081 points (-1.82%). The negativity can be attributed to regional tension with Afghanistan, where Pakistan carried o...",

New Zealand would have joined England in the knockouts with a win in their final Super Eights match and they scored 159-6 after opting to bat. England lost wickets early and looked like they would be squeezed out at 117-6, needing 43 from the last three overs. But Ahmed and Jacks took 22 off the 18th over from Glenn Phillips to turn the match on its head. Ahmed blasted 19 off seven balls in his first T20 World Cup match alongside Jacks, who made an unbeaten 32 off 18, to see England to 161-6 with three balls to spare.
