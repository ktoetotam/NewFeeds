  "executive_summary": "The Iran-US conflict has reached a critical inflection point following US-Israeli strikes on Iran that reportedly killed Supreme Leader Khamenei. Iran has launched comprehensive retaliatory attacks—ballistic missiles and drones—against Israel, the US, and Gulf Arab states. Over 330 incidents in 48 hours with 122 classified as Major severity. The conflict has expanded beyond Iran-US to encompass the entire Middle East with Bahrain, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar directly targeted. Airspace closures and civilian casualties (schools, hotels) signal uncontrolled escalation.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict will continue to escalate over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei's death announced and an interim Leadership Council established, Iran will likely maintain its offensive posture to demonstrate resolve. US and Israeli forces will likely conduct additional strikes on Iranian military infrastructure. Gulf states remain in the direct firing line — Bahrain and UAE face continued Iranian missile/drone attacks. The probability of further expansion to include additional Iranian proxies (Hezbollah, Houthis) is HIGH. Civilian casualties and infrastructure damage will accumulate, increasing humanitarian crisis and international pressure for ceasefire.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Iranian proxies (Hezbollah, Houthis) entering conflict — multi-front war",
      "Iran attacks critical energy infrastructure (Saudi, UAE oil terminals) — global energy crisis",
      "US aircraft carrier or major naval asset hit — potential for catastrophic escalation",
      "Israeli ground invasion of Iran — extreme escalation scenario",
      "Turkey or Pakistan drawn into conflict — regional bloc formation",
      "Cyberattacks on Gulf financial systems — economic warfare"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation appears unlikely in the near-term. The killing of Iran's Supreme Leader represents an irreversible escalation that removes a key figure for diplomatic off-ramps. The IRGC and interim Leadership Council will likely prioritize retaliation over negotiation to maintain legitimacy. US and Israel have achieved their primary military objectives and may continue strikes. International pressure from UN, Pakistan, and Turkey exists but carries limited weight. A ceasefire would require major power intervention (Russia, China) or a fundamental shift in US policy — neither appears imminent. The most likely pathway involves exhausted Iranian offensive capability followed by negotiated temporary ceasefire, but this remains 72+ hours away at minimum."
