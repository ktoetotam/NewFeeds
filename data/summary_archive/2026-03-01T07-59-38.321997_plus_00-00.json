  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US armed conflict has reached MAJOR escalation levels following US-Israeli 'Operation Epic Fury' strikes on 2026-02-28, with Iran responding through mass ballistic missile and drone attacks across the region. Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei is reportedly killed (unverified), triggering a leadership vacuum and nationalist protests in Iran. Iran has struck 14+ US military bases across Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and Gulf states, while targeting Israeli cities and Gulf commercial hubs (Dubai, Doha, Manama). The IRGC Navy has engaged US naval assets directly, and civilian casualty incidents (school strikes in Iran) risk further escalation. 378 incidents recorded in 24h window.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict trajectory indicates continued HIGH intensity over 24-72h. With Khamenei's death reported (unverified), Iran is likely to experience a leadership transition period but IRGC has vowed 'more severe retaliatory measures.' Iran's simultaneous attacks on 14 US bases and Gulf cities demonstrate willingness to expand the conflict geographically. The IRGC Navy's direct engagement of US naval assets marks a dangerous threshold. Expect: continued Iranian missile/drone volleys toward US bases and Israeli cities; possible Houthi escalation in Red Sea; potential Iranian cyber attacks on Gulf infrastructure; and international diplomatic pressure mounting (UN meeting March 2 on Iran nuclear program).",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Iranian attacks on Gulf civilian infrastructure (Dubai, Doha) could draw more Arab states into direct conflict",
      "US aircraft carrier or major naval asset strike would dramatically widen maritime conflict",
      "Iranian retaliation for civilian casualties (school strikes) could target Israeli population centers directly",
      "Potential Israel strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities - 'red line' scenario",
      "IRGC announcing new wave of missile attacks indicates sustained campaign, not one-time strike",
      "Khamenei's death (if confirmed) could trigger unpredictable leadership decisions or nationalist escalation",
      "Protesters at US Embassy in Baghdad could escalate to embassy attack scenario"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation appears unlikely in 24-72h window given IRGC's explicit vow for 'more severe retaliatory measures' and confirmed mass casualty incidents on both sides. However, potential off-ramps include: Iran completing its major retaliation cycle and reaching 'sufficient response' threshold; US/Israel achieving deterrence through demonstrated capability; or external pressure from Russia (calling for IAEA meeting) or China (economic interests in Gulf stability) facilitating back-channel negotiations. The March 2 IAEA extraordinary meeting provides a diplomatic venue, though nuclear escalation may follow if Iran blames US/Israel for civilian attacks. Humanitarian concerns (civilian casualties) may generate international pressure but unlikely to halt military operations in near-term."
