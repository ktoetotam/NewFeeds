  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with further direct military engagements between Iran and the US, including potential strikes on additional strategic targets. Regional allies of both sides may become increasingly involved, exacerbating instability. The risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation remains high, particularly in the maritime domain and near critical infrastructure.",

      "Direct military engagement between US and Iranian conventional forces.",
      "Iran targeting additional US bases or allied assets in the Gulf region.",

      "Increased involvement of proxy groups, such as Hezbollah or Iraqi militias."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially through a UN-led mediation effort or direct negotiations between the US and Iran. Regional powers like Qatar, Jordan, and France could play a role in facilitating dialogue. However, given the current trajectory and lack of trust between the parties, a diplomatic resolution appears unlikely in the short term without significant external pressure or a mutual agreement to pause hostilities."
