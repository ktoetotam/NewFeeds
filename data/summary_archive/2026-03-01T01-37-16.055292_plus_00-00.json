  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has escalated to full-scale regional war following a US-Israeli coordinated strike on Iran on 28 February. Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei is reportedly killed, triggering a leadership vacuum and massive Iranian retaliation across multiple fronts — ballistic missiles fired at Israel, strikes on 14+ US bases across Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and attacks on UAE targets including Dubai landmarks. Gulf states are now direct targets. Threat level remains MAJOR with 257 incidents in 24 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "Conflict will intensify over next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei reportedly killed and IRGC leadership in disarray, Iran's military response may become less calibrated and more retaliatory. US B-2 bomber deployment signals further kinetic escalation. Gulf states (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar) will remain primary Iranian targets. Maritime domain increasingly contested with IRGC Navy attacks on US vessels. Israeli operations against Iranian air defense and missile sites ongoing. Civilian casualty incidents (school strikes) risk further international condemnation and complicate diplomatic off-ramps.",

      "Khamenei's death triggers power vacuum — IRGC hardliners may take control and authorize unrestricted retaliation",
      "Iran targets CIA facility in Dubai — if confirmed, represents attack on US intelligence infrastructure, likely triggering harsh US response",

      "Oil infrastructure strikes — if Iranian missiles hit Saudi or UAE oil facilities, global energy crisis"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "No immediate de-escalation pathway visible. UN Secretary-General expressed regret over diplomacy failure. Turkey's Erdoğan-Trump phone call represents only diplomatic engagement. Iran's leadership vacuum makes any negotiated ceasefire difficult — IRGC command structure may not have authority to negotiate. US domestic political calculus (Trump's Maga agenda) suggests continued kinetic pressure. International pressure mounting but unlikely to stop hostilities in near-term. Gulf state mediation possible but complicated by their status as direct Iranian targets."
