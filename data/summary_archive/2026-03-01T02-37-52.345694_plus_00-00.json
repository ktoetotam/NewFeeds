  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has escalated to an unprecedented level with the confirmed death of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in coordinated US-Israeli airstrikes on February 28. Iran has responded with mass missile attacks on Israel and 14+ US military bases across the Middle East, including strikes on Gulf states. The IRGC has announced imminent major offensive operations. Threat level remains MAJOR with 267 incidents in 24 hours. A leadership vacuum in Tehran and potential power struggle within IRGC create significant uncertainty for the coming 24-72 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to intensify significantly over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei's death confirmed and IRGC announcing imminent major offensive operations, Iran will likely execute large-scale retaliatory strikes against US bases and Israeli targets. The death of Iran's supreme leader may either provoke overwhelming retaliation or create a command vacuum that slows Iranian response. US B-2 stealth bomber deployment signals potential expansion of precision strikes against critical Iranian infrastructure. Gulf states remain in the crossfire with direct attacks on Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Civilian infrastructure strikes will likely continue, increasing humanitarian crisis.",

      "Russia or China intervenes diplomatically or materially"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation pathways remain extremely limited in the immediate 24-72h window. The death of Iran's Supreme Leader removes a key decision-maker and may either provoke overwhelming retaliation or create leadership chaos that could potentially be exploited for diplomatic off-ramps. UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure, indicating international pressure exists but has limited leverage. Turkey's Erdogan-Trump call and Saudi Crown Prince communications suggest back-channel diplomatic activity may emerge, but IRGC's announced offensive intentions suggest kinetic operations will dominate before any diplomatic de-escalation becomes viable."
