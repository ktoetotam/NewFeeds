  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has escalated to critical levels following US-Israeli strikes on Iran that reportedly killed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and targeted over 20 Iranian provinces. Iran has launched massive retaliatory attacks, striking 14-27 US bases across Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE, plus multiple ballistic missile barrages against Israel. Naval incidents include IRGC missile attacks on US support ships and suicide attacks on Bahrain naval command. Civilian casualties reported from Iranian school strikes (85+ children). Gulf states are now direct targets, with explosions in Doha and Dubai port. The conflict has expanded geographically and involves direct US-Iran military engagement for the first time.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to intensify over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei confirmed dead, Iran faces a leadership vacuum that may either/paralyze decision-making or trigger erratic retaliatory behavior. IRGC has announced continued attacks on US and Israeli assets. The sixth wave of attacks suggests sustained offensive operations. Gulf states (UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) are now direct targets, increasing regional spread. Israel's northern border remains active with Hezbollah-related siren activity. The US is likely to expand its retaliatory footprint. Civilian casualties and infrastructure damage create escalation momentum.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Iranian leadership succession crisis could trigger irrational military decisions or use of unconventional weapons",
      "Gulf states directly targeted may request US escalation or take independent military action",
      "Hezbollah and other proxies could open additional fronts against Israel",
      "Civilian casualty photographs/video from Iranian school strikes could provoke international pressure for harder response",
      "Naval escalation in Gulf could disrupt global oil shipping lanes",
      "Potential Iranian cyberattacks on Gulf critical infrastructure"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation pathways remain extremely limited in the immediate term. The death of Khamenei removes a key decision-maker from Iranian side but may harden IRGC resolve. A ceasefire would require: direct US-Iran communication (currently nonexistent), IRGC command and control degradation, or overwhelming US-Israel military dominance forcing Iran to the table. International mediation by Russia, China, or UN is possible but unlikely given current momentum. The 40-day national mourning period in Iran may provide a tactical pause but is unlikely to translate to diplomatic engagement."
