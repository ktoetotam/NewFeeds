  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with further direct military engagements between Iran, the US, and its allies. Iran is expected to intensify its retaliatory attacks on US and Israeli assets, while the US and Israel may expand their strikes on Iranian targets. The risk of regional states being drawn into the conflict remains high, particularly if Iranian proxies become more active.",

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially involving global powers like China, Russia, and the UN Security Council. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with assurances from the US and Israel to halt further strikes, could pave the way for negotiations. However, given the current trajectory and mutual distrust, such an outcome appears unlikely without significant international pressure and mediation."
