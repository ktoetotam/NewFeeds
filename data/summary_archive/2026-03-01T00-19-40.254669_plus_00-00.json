  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with Iran and US forces engaged in retaliatory strikes and direct military engagements.

A potential ceasefire could be negotiated if both Iran and the US see a strategic advantage in de-escalation, possibly involving third-party mediation. However, given the current trajectory, such efforts face significant challenges and may require a significant shift in the conflict's dynamics."
