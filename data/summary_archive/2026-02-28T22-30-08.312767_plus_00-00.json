  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating with further direct military engagements between Iran, the US, and its allies. The involvement of regional proxies and the potential for miscalculation or miscommunication heighten the risk of broader regional instability. International diplomatic efforts may intensify, but immediate de-escalation appears unlikely.",

      "Direct military confrontation between US and Iranian conventional forces.",
      "Increased targeting of civilian infrastructure and population centers by both sides.",
      "Escalation involving regional proxies such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, or other IRGC-affiliated groups.",
      "Further disruption of critical infrastructure, including energy facilities and transportation networks."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require a combination of direct diplomatic engagement between the US and Iran, supported by key regional actors such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and international mediation efforts led by the UN or other major powers. Confidence-building measures, such as mutual stand-down agreements and humanitarian corridors, could help reduce tensions, but the current climate of hostility and mistrust presents significant obstacles."
