  "executive_summary": "The Iran-US conflict has reached an unprecedented level of escalation as of 28 February 2026.

Civilian casualties are significant, including confirmed school strikes in southern Iran. The status of Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei remains unverified.

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is on a trajectory of significant escalation. With B-2 stealth bombers potentially joining operations and Iran demonstrating continued ballistic missile volleys against Israel and US bases, the next 24-72 hours will likely see intensified strikes. Iran's leadership situation remains uncertain — if Khamenei's death is confirmed, IRGC command chaos could either paralyze or radicalize Iranian military decision-making. The Gulf states (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait) are now direct targets, expanding the conflict geographically. Civilian infrastructure strikes (schools, tourist areas) increase humanitarian crisis and international pressure.",

      "IRGC succession crisis may lead to desperate or irrational military actions",

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation pathways are extremely limited at present. UN diplomatic efforts have failed, and both sides are in active retaliation cycles. The only plausible de-escalation routes would be: (1) a decisive military outcome that forces one side to the negotiating table, (2) internal Iranian leadership collapse creating a power vacuum that halts operations, or (3) massive international pressure (UN, EU, China, Russia) forcing ceasefire. Currently, no third-party mediation appears active or credible. The conflict trajectory points toward continued escalation through at least 72 hours."
