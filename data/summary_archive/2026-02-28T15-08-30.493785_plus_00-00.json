  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has dramatically escalated with multiple direct military engagements, including coordinated airstrikes, ballistic missile attacks, and naval confrontations. The situation has deteriorated significantly in the last 24 hours, with both sides suffering critical losses and regional stability at severe risk. The conflict's expansion to multiple fronts, including Israel, Gulf states, and IRGC proxies, indicates a rapidly intensifying crisis with no immediate resolution in sight.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US likely to intensify attacks on strategic assets and military targets. The involvement of regional actors such as Israel and Gulf states will further complicate the situation, increasing the risk of broader regional instability. The international community's ability to mediate or de-escalate the crisis appears limited at this stage.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Further direct military engagements between US and Iranian forces, including in the maritime domain.",
      "Escalation by Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah or Houthi attacks on US allies or assets.",
      "Potential for miscalculations or unintended escalations due to the rapid pace of military actions."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would likely require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially through a neutral third party such as the UN or regional actors like Oman. However, given the current trajectory, a pause in hostilities appears unlikely without a clear commitment from both Iran and the US to engage in negotiations, which seems improbable in the short term."
