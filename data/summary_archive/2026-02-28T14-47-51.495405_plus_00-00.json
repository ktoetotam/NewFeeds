  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with Iran and its proxies expected to launch further retaliatory attacks against US and Israeli assets.

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially through a UN Security Council meeting or mediation by regional actors like Oman. However, given the current trajectory and lack of direct communication channels, a diplomatic resolution appears unlikely in the short term. A pause in hostilities may depend on implicit agreements or mutual deterrence as both sides assess the costs of further escalation."
