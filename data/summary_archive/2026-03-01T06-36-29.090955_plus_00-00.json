  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict trajectory indicates continued MAJOR-intensity hostilities over 24-72h. With 14 US bases struck and direct maritime engagement between IRGC Navy and US forces, reciprocal US strikes are highly likely. Iran's interim leadership council will likely authorize continued retaliatory operations. The death of Supreme Leader Khamenei (if confirmed) would either trigger a period of strategic ambiguity or massive retaliatory response to demonstrate continuity of regime resolve. Gulf states (Bahrain, Qatar, UAE) will remain primary targets of Iranian retaliation. Civilian infrastructure attacks (airports, hotels) suggest Iran expanding target set beyond military assets.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "If Khamenei's death confirmed - potential for regime to authorize WMD use or unlimited retaliation",
      "US civilian casualties in Gulf states could trigger 'unprecedented force' response per Trump warning",
      "Iranian attacks on Gulf oil infrastructure would trigger global energy crisis",
      "Israeli entry into direct hostilities with Iran could expand toLebanon/Hezbollah front",
      "Pro Iranian proxies (Houthis, Iraqi militias) activation could open additional fronts",
      "Naval escalation in Persian Gulf - US 5th Fleet potentially targeted directly",
      "Chinese citizens advisory in Iran suggests potential for regional power intervention"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation pathways remain extremely limited in 24-72h window. UN Secretary-General expressed regret at diplomacy failure (Anadolu). US has committed to unconditional defense of allies per UN envoy. Iran's parliamentary statement frames conflict as existential - 'beginning of new phase of resistance.' Any ceasefire would require major power mediation (Russia, China) or complete exhaustion of one side's military capacity. Current trajectory suggests intensification before potential stalemate. The 40-day mourning period in Iran could provide symbolic pause but unlikely to halt military operations."
