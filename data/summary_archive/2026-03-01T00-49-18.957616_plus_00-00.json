  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "Conflict is on an escalatory trajectory with no sign of de-escalation. Iran has demonstrated capacity for large-scale coordinated strikes across 14+ US bases and against Israel simultaneously. IRGC continues launching new waves of attacks. The death of Khamenei — if confirmed — would create command vacuum and potentially fragment IRGC decision-making. Gulf states remain directly targeted. Expect continued heavy exchange over next 24-72h with potential for even broader regional involvement.",

      "Russian sources (RBC, TASS) reporting significant escalation may prompt Moscow intervention"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Trump mentioned having several 'off ramp' options for ending operation — potential diplomatic channel via Saudi Crown Prince mediation. UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure but continues calling for de-escalation. Turkish President Erdoğan in contact with Trump about Iran-Gulf tensions — possible mediation role. However, with IRGC actively launching new attack waves and US-Israeli operations continuing inside Iran, immediate de-escalation appears unlikely without major diplomatic intervention or significant military pause."
