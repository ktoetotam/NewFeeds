  "executive_summary": "The Iran-US conflict has escalated to an unprecedented level with the reported killing of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in coordinated US-Israeli airstrikes on 28 February. Iran has responded with massive retaliatory strikes across the region, targeting Israel directly with ballistic missiles and striking at least 14 US military bases across Iraq, Syria, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. A leadership vacuum has emerged in Tehran with a three-member council assuming temporary control, while the IRGC has vowed continued retaliation. The conflict has expanded geographically beyond Iran-Israel to encompass the entire Gulf region, with direct attacks on civilian infrastructure including Dubai and Jebel Ali Port.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to intensify over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei confirmed dead and a transitional council in place, Iran will likely experience a period of internal consolidation but IRGC has signaled continued military operations. Expect additional waves of Iranian ballistic missile and drone attacks on US bases and Israeli territory. The IRGC's vow to avenge Khamenei suggests asymmetric retaliation including potential attacks on Gulf state infrastructure. Regional escalation is probable as US and Israel prepare for sustained operations and Iran mobilizes proxy forces.",

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation appears highly unlikely in the near term given IRGC's vows of continued retaliation and the strategic shock of Khamenei's death. The US has called for IRGC cooperation with Iranian people for regime change - signaling intent to sustain pressure. UN Secretary-General has warned of uncontrollable escalation but diplomatic channels appear failed. The only potential off-ramps would require: major power intervention (Russia/China), complete IRGC decapitation eliminating command structure, or internal Iranian political collapse making continued war unsustainable - none appear imminent."
