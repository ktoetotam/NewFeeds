  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with Iran and US-Israel forces engaging in further direct military confrontations.

    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially involving key regional actors such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey, alongside international bodies like the UN. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with confidence-building measures and negotiations on contentious issues like Iran's nuclear program, could provide a path to de-escalation. However, given the current trajectory, such outcomes appear challenging without significant external pressure and compromise from all parties."
