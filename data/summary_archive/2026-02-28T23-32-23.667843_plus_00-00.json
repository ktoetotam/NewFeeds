  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating with further direct military engagements between Iran and the US-Israel alliance.

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation could be pursued through urgent diplomatic engagement, potentially involving international mediators such as the UN or key regional powers like Turkey and Qatar. However, given the current trajectory and the lack of direct communication between the US and Iran, a swift resolution appears unlikely without a significant shift in strategic objectives or leadership on either side."
