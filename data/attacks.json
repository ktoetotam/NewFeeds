The office said that Dubai’s Civil Defence teams are “continuing their efforts to fully extinguish the fire” at the commercial port, which is the largest in the Middle East. Jebel Ali Port is located just south of Palm Jumeirah, where an explosion was reported earlier. A missile strike linked to Iran also triggered a fire at Dubai’s Burj Al Arab, one of the city’s most recognisable landmarks. Dubai authorities confirm that debris resulting from an aerial interception caused a fire at one of the berths at Jebel Ali Port. Dubai Civil Defense teams responded immediately and are continuing their efforts to fully extinguish the fire.
