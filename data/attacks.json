Pretty decent day one for Iran. Expected performance by the US et al. Global shipping might be the main casualty here. Unknown what will happen to oil & gas. The main damage caused by Iran et al in recent years was by shutting down the Suez. The US also appears to be shifting towards lower-cost kamikaze drones, taking a page out of Iran's book. Iran focused on radars and anything which aids interceptions. This is better than hitting symbolic buildings like last time. They're taking taking big hits and their leadership may or may not be dead, but they prepared for decentralized military coordination. So it's like a unit by unit basis of commanders making self authorized decisions.
