  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with Iran and the US/Israel engaging in further direct military confrontations. The risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation remains high, particularly if reports of Khamenei's death are confirmed. Regional actors, including Gulf states and proxy groups, may be drawn further into the conflict, exacerbating instability.",

      "Direct military engagement between US and Iranian conventional forces expands to other domains, such as cyber or electronic warfare.",

      "Leadership upheaval in Iran leads to unpredictable actions or internal power struggles, further complicating the conflict."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require concerted diplomatic efforts by international actors, such as Russia, China, and European powers, to mediate a ceasefire and initiate negotiations. However, given the current trajectory and lack of trust between the parties, a diplomatic resolution appears unlikely in the short term. The involvement of global powers and the UN Security Council may be necessary to prevent further escalation."
