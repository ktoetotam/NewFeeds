  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating with further direct military engagements between Iran and the US-Israel alliance. Iran is expected to retaliate against recent strikes, potentially targeting additional US assets or allied infrastructure. The risk of regional powers being drawn into the conflict remains high, particularly if Iran expands its attacks on Gulf states. Civilian casualties and infrastructure damage are likely to increase, exacerbating humanitarian concerns.",

      "Iran launching wider attacks on US bases or allied targets in the Middle East.",
      "US and Israel conducting more aggressive strikes targeting Iranian leadership or critical infrastructure.",
      "Escalation into a broader regional conflict involving additional countries such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require concerted diplomatic efforts by international actors such as the UN, China, or Russia to mediate negotiations. A potential pathway could involve a ceasefire agreement followed by talks facilitated by neutral parties. However, given the current intensity and mutual hostility, such efforts face significant challenges and would likely require a significant shift in the strategic calculus of the US and Iran."
