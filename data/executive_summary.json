  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US–Israel conflict has reached a critical escalation point following the US-Israeli coordinated strike on Iran on 2026-02-28, which Iranian and multiple international sources now confirm killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran has responded with massive retaliatory attacks across the region—ballistic missile barrages on Israel, strikes on 14+ US bases in Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the Gulf, and naval engagements against US vessels. The IRGC has announced its 'most devastating offensive operation in history.' The threat level remains MAJOR with 276 incidents in 48 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is on an escalatory trajectory with no immediate de-escalation pathways visible. With Khamenei's death confirmed and IRGC vowing 'most devastating offensive,' expect continued Iranian retaliation against US bases and Israel over the next 24-72 hours. The US is likely to respond with additional waves of precision strikes including B-2 bombers targeting Iranian infrastructure. Regional escalation will intensify as Gulf states remain in the firing line—airport and school closures indicate governments expect prolonged instability. Civilian casualties from school strikes may provoke additional international pressure but unlikely to halt military operations.",

      "Iranian attacks spread to additional Gulf states or escalate targeting of civilian infrastructure",

      "Power vacuum in Tehran triggers internal instability—IRGC may act independently without centralized control",

      "Hezbollah, Houthis, or other Iranian proxies open new fronts escalating multi-theater conflict",
      "Israel conducts additional strikes on Iranian leadership or nuclear facilities"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation appears highly unlikely in the 24-72h window. The only plausible pathways would be: (1) Complete collapse of Iranian military capacity rendering further retaliation impossible—unlikely given IRGC's dispersed assets; (2) US decision to halt strikes after achieving leadership elimination objectives—possible but would invite further Iranian aggression; (3) International mediation by UN, Turkey, or European powers—UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure, suggesting limited diplomatic leverage. The IRGC's explicit vow to continue until 'aggression ends' and Trump's apparent commitment to regime change objectives indicate both sides are locked into an escalation spiral with no off-ramp visible in the near term."
