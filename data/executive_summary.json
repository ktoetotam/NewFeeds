  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US-Israeli alliance demonstrating a willingness to expand the scope of attacks. Iran's missile strikes on US bases and infrastructure in the Gulf suggest a focus on asymmetric warfare, while the US and Israel may intensify airstrikes on Iranian targets. The involvement of regional proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis could further complicate the situation.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Direct military engagement between US and Iranian forces in the Gulf.",
      "Expanded missile attacks by Iran targeting additional US bases and allied countries.",
      "Increased involvement of Iranian-backed proxies in attacks on Israel and US assets."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require diplomatic intervention from major powers such as China, Russia, and European states, potentially through the UN Security Council. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with assurances from the US and Israel to halt further strikes on Iranian territory, could pave the way for negotiations. However, given the current trajectory, such an outcome appears unlikely without significant international pressure."
