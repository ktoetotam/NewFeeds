  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US–Israel conflict has reached a critical escalation point with major military engagements across multiple fronts. US and Israeli forces launched coordinated airstrikes on Iran targeting IRGC infrastructure and leadership, while Iran responded with ballistic missile barrages against Israel and US bases across the Gulf region. Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei is reportedly killed, triggering a leadership transition with Ahmad Vahidi appointed as new IRGC Commander-in-Chief. The conflict has expanded geographically with strikes on Gulf states, naval incidents in the Gulf, and civilian casualties on both sides. The threat level remains MAJOR with 367 incidents in the past 24 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict trajectory points toward continued escalation over the next 24-72 hours. Iran has announced 'more severe retaliatory measures' following its leadership losses, and the IRGC's new command structure under Vahidi will likely prioritize demonstrating continued military capability. The death of Iran's Supreme Leader creates a power vacuum that could either unify Iranian response or create strategic confusion. US and Israel maintain offensive momentum, but Iranian strikes on 14 US bases and Gulf cities demonstrate substantial retaliation capacity. Without diplomatic intervention, the conflict will likely expand with additional Iranian proxy attacks and potential Israeli/US responses to civilian casualties in Iran.",

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Omani mediation efforts with Jordanian and European officials represent the most viable diplomatic channel. UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure, indicating international pressure for de-escalation. However, with Iranian leadership under existential threat and US/Israel demonstrating resolve to continue operations, any pause would require significant face-saving formula for both sides. Gulf states' condemnation of Iranian attacks on their territory may create pressure on Iran to limit regional spillover while allowing it to maintain focus on US/Israel targets."
