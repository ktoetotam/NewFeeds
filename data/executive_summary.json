  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US likely to intensify attacks on strategic targets. The involvement of regional proxies and allies will further complicate the situation, increasing the risk of miscalculation and broader regional instability.

      "Direct military engagement between US and Iranian forces could expand to other domains, such as cyber or electronic warfare.",
      "Iran may escalate attacks on US allies and assets in the region, prompting a stronger US response.",
      "The involvement of additional regional actors, such as Turkey or Russia, could further complicate the conflict dynamics."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would likely require a combination of diplomatic intervention by major powers, such as Russia or China, and a mutual agreement to cease hostilities. However, given the current trajectory and lack of trust between the parties, this remains unlikely in the short term. A potential pause in hostilities could emerge if both sides seek to avoid further escalation to full-scale war, but this would depend on the willingness of Iran and the US to engage in negotiations."
