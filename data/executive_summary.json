  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US likely to intensify attacks on strategic assets.

    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require diplomatic intervention from major powers like Russia, China, or the UN Security Council, coupled with a mutual ceasefire agreement. However, given the current trajectory and lack of trust between parties, diplomatic efforts face significant challenges. Regional mediators like Oman may play a role if given the opportunity to engage both sides."
