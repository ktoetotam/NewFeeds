  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US demonstrating a willingness to engage in direct military actions. The involvement of regional actors such as Israel and Gulf states will further complicate the situation, increasing the risk of broader regional instability. The absence of clear diplomatic efforts or de-escalation signals suggests the conflict will persist in the short term.",

      "Further direct military engagements between Iran and the US, including potential attacks on additional strategic assets.",
      "Escalation involving regional proxies, such as Hezbollah or Houthi forces, expanding the conflict's geographic scope.",
      "Increased targeting of civilian infrastructure, leading to higher civilian casualties and broader humanitarian concerns."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require significant diplomatic intervention, potentially involving global powers such as China, Russia, or the UN Security Council. A ceasefire agreement or negotiations facilitated by neutral third parties could offer a path to de-escalation, but this would necessitate a mutual willingness to engage in dialogue, which is currently absent."
