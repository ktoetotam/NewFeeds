  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has reached a critical escalation point with multiple major developments in the past 24 hours. The US and Israel conducted coordinated airstrikes on Iran targeting IRGC infrastructure and leadership, reportedly killing Supreme Leader Khamenei along with senior IRGC commanders. Iran has responded with massive retaliatory strikes against Israel and at least 14 US military bases across Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the Gulf region. Naval assets have been targeted, and civilian casualties have been reported from both sides. A three-member interim council has assumed leadership in Tehran, while the IRGC has vowed revenge and announced its 'most devastating offensive operation in history.'",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is on an escalation trajectory with no immediate de-escalation signals. Iran's interim leadership council will likely authorize continued retaliatory operations, and the IRGC's announcement of 'most devastating offensive' suggests additional large-scale attacks are imminent. US B-2 bomber deployment indicates America is preparing for expanded strikes against Iranian infrastructure. With Khamenei's death confirmed and senior military leadership eliminated, Iran may experience temporary command-and-control degradation but will likely respond through proxy forces and continued missile barrages. The next 24-72 hours will likely see continued exchanges with potential for further major escalation.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "IRGC's 'most devastating offensive' announced — likely large-scale attacks on US bases and Israeli territory within 24-48h",
      "B-2 stealth bombers joining attacks could trigger Iranian retaliation against critical regional infrastructure",
      "Khamenei's death may provoke Iran to authorize use of asymmetric capabilities including naval mines, WMD threats",

      "Nuclear facility targeting remains a critical escalation flashpoint not yet addressed in reporting"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "No immediate de-escalation pathways identified. The killing of Iran's Supreme Leader represents an irreversible political escalation that eliminates diplomatic channels in the near term. A ceasefire would require major power broker intervention (Russia, China) or complete military exhaustion. The UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure, indicating international mediation attempts have failed. Any de-escalation would likely require a mutual ceasefire announcement with external guarantees, though current rhetoric from all parties suggests maximalist positions."
