  "executive_summary": "The Iran-US conflict has reached an unprecedented level of escalation following the US-Israeli coordinated strikes on Iran that resulted in the reported death of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and mass casualties among Iranian civilians and military personnel. Iran has responded with widespread missile and drone attacks targeting Israel and at least 27 US military bases across the Middle East, including installations in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE. The conflict has expanded beyond traditional battlefields with attacks on Dubai, Jebel Ali Port, and civilian infrastructure inside Iran. The threat level remains MAJOR with 316 incidents in the last 24 hours and no indication of de-escalation.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to continue escalating over the next 24-72 hours. Iran has announced continued attacks on US and Israeli targets, and there is no indication of de-escalation. With the death of Supreme Leader Khamenei, Iran may experience leadership fragmentation butIRGC's institutional strength suggests military operations will continue aggressively. The US has warned of unprecedented force if Iran escalates further. Regional instability will likely spread as Gulf states become more directly involved and civilian casualties mount, increasing international pressure but limited diplomatic pathways available in the immediate term.",

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Immediate de-escalation pathways appear extremely limited. The death of Supreme Leader Khamenei removes a key figure for potential negotiations. UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure. European allies are distancing from US actions, limiting coordinated Western pressure. The most plausible pathway involves either: (1) mutual exhaustion leading to ceasefire after significant damage exchange, (2) catastrophic escalation forcing great power intervention, or (3) internal Iranian political crisis diverting resources from military operations — none appear likely within the 72-hour window."
