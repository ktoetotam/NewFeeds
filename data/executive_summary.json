    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation could be pursued through diplomatic channels, potentially involving UN mediation or direct US-Iran negotiations. However, given the current trajectory, a pause in hostilities is unlikely without a clear demonstration of force or a mutual understanding to de-escalate. The involvement of international actors such as Russia, China, and European powers could also play a role in facilitating dialogue."
