  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has reached a critical escalation point following a US-Israeli coordinated strike that reportedly killed Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei and senior military leadership. Iran has responded with mass missile and drone attacks on Israel, Gulf states, and 14+ US military bases across the Middle East. All 30 classified attack events in the feed are rated MAJOR severity. The death of Khamenei creates a leadership vacuum while IRGC vows further retaliation. Threat level remains MAJOR with 360 incidents in 24 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict trajectory points to continued high-intensity hostilities over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei's reported death and senior military leadership eliminated, Iran faces a command vacuum but IRGC has vowed severe retaliation. Iran has demonstrated capacity to launch coordinated multi-wave attacks across 14+ US bases and Gulf cities. US and Israel maintain offensive posture with no ceasefire announced. The IRGC's announcement of 'more severe retaliatory measures' suggests Iran will escalate rather than de-escalate. Regional allies (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan) are now directly in the firing line. Expect continued missile/drone exchanges, possible new US naval targeting, and expanded humanitarian casualties.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Iranian retaliation could target additional Gulf state infrastructure — Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain at continued risk",
      "IRGC proxies (Hezbollah, Houthis) may launch coordinated attacks expanding multi-front conflict",
      "Further strikes on US naval assets in Gulf — US Navy support ship already hit, escalation cycle possible",
      "Iranian cyberattacks on Gulf state infrastructure likely as conflict continues",
      "Risk of accidental NATO/Gulf state escalation if attacks misinterpreted",
      "Humanitarian crisis deepening — school strikes and civilian casualties could provoke international intervention",
      "Nuclear facilities could be targeted — escalation into WMD domain remains possible"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation pathways are extremely limited at present. The death of Khamenei removes a key figure for potential negotiations and creates a leadership vacuum that may delay any diplomatic engagement. Oman's mediation efforts represent the most viable channel but have not produced results. Iraq's call for ceasefire has gone unheeded. For de-escalation to occur, either Iran must decide the cost of continued retaliation outweighs benefits, or the US must choose to accept a ceasefire despite its military advantage — neither appears likely in the near term. The UN Secretary-General's expression of regret over diplomatic failure underscores the collapsed diplomatic channel."
