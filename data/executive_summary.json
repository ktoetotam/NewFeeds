  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with further direct military engagements between Iran, the US, and Israel. Iran's retaliatory strikes on US bases and regional targets will likely persist, and the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation remains high. The involvement of regional actors and the potential for expanded hostilities in the Gulf could exacerbate instability.",

      "Direct military confrontation between US and Iranian forces in the Gulf region.",
      "Escalation of attacks on civilian infrastructure and population centers, increasing humanitarian concerns.",

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially through a UN Security Council resolution or direct negotiations facilitated by regional powers like Qatar or Turkey. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with confidence-building measures, could help stabilize the situation, but the current trajectory suggests a low likelihood of immediate de-escalation without significant external pressure."
