  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is on a steep escalation trajectory. With Khamenei's death (if confirmed), Iran faces a leadership vacuum likely triggering intensified retaliatory operations to demonstrate resolve. IRGC has announced 'more severe retaliatory measures' planned. US threats of 'unprecedented force' suggest continued heavy strikes. The 14+ US bases struck will likely prompt significant American military response. Regional powers (Gulf states, Iraq) are directly engaged. Expect: continued Iranian missile/drone attacks on US assets and Israel; expanded US-Israeli operations inside Iran; potential Houthi escalation in Red Sea; civilian casualties to rise; aviation/supply chain disruptions to persist for 72+ hours.",

      "Russian involvement (TASS, RIA Novosti reporting extensively) — potential for broader internationalization"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Diplomatic channels appear largely collapsed — UN Secretary-General regrets 'diplomacy failure.' However, de-escalation pathways remain: (1) Iran suffers sufficient military damage that leadership calculates continued resistance is futile; (2) US achieves strategic objectives (leadership decapitation, IRGC degradation) and declares victory while accepting ceasefire; (3) Gulf state mediators (Saudi, UAE) persuade both sides to accept brokered halt; (4) Mutual exhaustion after 48-72 hours of intensive strikes creates window for negotiated ceasefire. Currently, none of these appear likely in the immediate 24-72h window given the intensity of recent attacks and rhetorical escalation from all sides."
