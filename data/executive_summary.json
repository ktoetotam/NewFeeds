  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has reached a critical inflection point following the US-Israeli airstrike on February 28 that killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran has responded with massive retaliatory strikes across the region, targeting Israel and 14 US military bases in Iraq, Syria, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The IRGC claims 200 US personnel killed in these strikes, while civilian casualties in Iran (including 85 children in school strikes) have been reported. The Gulf states are now direct combat zones, with missile interceptions occurring over Dubai, Doha, and Manama. Threat level remains MAJOR with 346 incidents in 24 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is on an escalating trajectory. With Khamenei dead and Iran forming a wartime leadership council, Iran will likely authorize continued and intensified retaliatory strikes against US assets and Gulf allies. The IRGC has announced 'more severe' measures are coming. US forces across 14+ bases have been struck, and Iranian missiles are actively targeting Gulf cities. Without diplomatic intervention, this escalates toward direct US-Iran naval confrontation in the Gulf and potential Iranian attacks on additional Gulf state infrastructure. The 48h/24h incident rates (346/348 major/high events) indicate sustained high-intensity combat, not de-escalation.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Iranian leadership vacuum may trigger erratic or maximalist military decisions by IRGC commanders",
      "IRGC threatens 'more severe retaliatory measures' — next 24-48h likely see additional large-scale strikes",
      "Gulf states (UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) now direct combat zones — risk of further civilian infrastructure hits",
      "US Naval assets in Gulf/Arabian Sea under active attack — risk of US escalation to target Iranian naval assets directly",
      "Israel continues targeted strikes inside Iran — risk of expanded Iranian ballistic missile response",
      "Suicide attacks on Bahrain US Fifth Fleet HQ indicate proxy/terror tactics escalating",
      "Risk of Iraq-based Iranian proxies (Kata'ib Hezbollah) activating against US embassy and personnel",
      "Potential for Iranian cyberattacks on Gulf state financial/military infrastructure"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Immediate de-escalation requires US decision to halt additional strikes on Iranian territory combined with Gulf state mediation (Qatar, Oman). However, with Khamenei killed and Iranian national mourning underway, domestic political pressure in Iran virtually eliminates any near-term (24-72h) pathway to ceasefire. The IRGC's explicit threat of 'more severe' retaliation means Iran will continue striking. UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure. Only a decisive US decision to accept ceasefire terms (likely brokered by Iraq or Oman) or complete military collapse of Iranian strike capability could halt escalation in the 72h window — both unlikely outcomes at present."
