  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both the US and Iran demonstrating a willingness to expand the scope of attacks.

    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially involving global powers such as China, Russia, or the UN Security Council. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with assurances on Iran's nuclear program and regional security concerns, could provide a framework for negotiations. However, given the current trajectory, diplomatic efforts face significant challenges and may require a pause in hostilities to gain traction."
