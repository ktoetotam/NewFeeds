  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has escalated to MAJOR Level 1 (Score 1390) following a US-Israeli coordinated airstrike on Iran on 2026-02-28. Iran has responded with massive ballistic missile barrages against Israel and strikes on 14+ US military bases across Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE. Unconfirmed reports claim Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei was killed in the strikes. The 24h window recorded 241 incidents (79 Major, 93 High). Regional airspace closures have caused thousands of flight cancellations. The conflict trajectory indicates continued escalation with Iran threatening further retaliation.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is on an escalating trajectory with no de-escalation signals. Iran has demonstrated capability and willingness to conduct large-scale simultaneous attacks on multiple US bases and Israeli targets. IRGC's announcement of continued waves (phases 3–4) suggests further retaliation is planned. If Khamenei's death is confirmed, leadership chaos may either paralyze or further radicalize Iranian response. US-Israeli forces will likely continue degrading Iranian military assets. Expect sustained intensity with daily major incidents for at least 48–72 hours.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Khamenei's confirmed death could trigger erratic or maximum-pressure Iranian response including WMD threshold actions",
      "Expanded Houthi involvement in Red Sea could open new front",
      "Israeli ground operations or expanded strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities",
      "China or Russia intervention escalating to great power confrontation",
      "Iranian attacks on Gulf oil infrastructure triggering global energy crisis"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Unlikely in 24–72h window. Possible pathways include: major power mediation (Turkey, China, Russia) pushing for ceasefire; complete collapse of Iranian command structure post-Khamenei; US domestic political pressure (war powers legislation) constraining further strikes; or overwhelming US-Israeli degradation of Iranian capacity forcing Tehran to accept negotiated settlement. Currently no diplomatic channel active — UN Secretary-General's regrets highlight failed diplomacy."
