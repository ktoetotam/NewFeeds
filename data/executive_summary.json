  "executive_summary": "The Iran-US conflict has reached an unprecedented level of escalation with the US and Israel launching coordinated strikes on Iran (Feb 28), resulting in reports of Khamenei's death and triggering Iran's comprehensive retaliatory missile campaign against Israel and US bases across the Gulf region. The IRGC has executed at least 14 waves of missile and drone strikes targeting US military installations in Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE, while also striking civilian infrastructure in Dubai. The death toll from the school strike in southern Iran has risen to 85, with international condemnation mounting. Threat level remains MAJOR with 248 incidents in 48 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to intensify significantly over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei's death unconfirmed but leadership succession in chaos, Iran may experience command-and-control disruption, potentially triggering either paralysis or irrational escalation. IRGC has demonstrated capacity for massed missile strikes across 14+ US bases and will likely continue waves of attacks. Israel faces maximum security alert with retaliatory threats. The death of 85+ children in the school strike creates significant international humanitarian pressure. Without diplomatic intervention, this conflict trajectory points toward regional war involving all Gulf states.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Khamenei's confirmed death could trigger catastrophic Iranian response with no rational constraints on escalation",
      "CIA facility strike in Dubai confirmed - US intelligence infrastructure now directly targeted, likely triggering US retaliation",
      "IRGC succession crisis may produce erratic military decision-making without proper civilian oversight",

      "Pro-Hamas Telegram channels threatening Tel Aviv attacks - Gaza front may rekindle",
      "Chinese involvement could escalate conflict beyond regional dimensions"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "Diplomatic channels remain minimal with UN peace talks failed. Turkish President Erdogan's call with Trump represents potential mediation pathway. However, with IRGC in active retaliation mode and Israel at maximum alert, immediate ceasefire appears unlikely without major concessions. The UN Secretary-General's warning of uncontrollable escalation may eventually force Security Council intervention, but current trajectories suggest 24-72 more hours of intensifying hostilities before either side seeks negotiated pause. Any de-escalation would require: (1) verified ceasefire on Iranian missile launches, (2) cessation of strikes on Iranian territory, (3) neutral third-party guarantor for both sides."
