  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating with further direct military engagements between Iran, the US, and regional allies. Iran's demonstrated capability to strike US bases and regional infrastructure suggests a protracted and increasingly intense confrontation. The involvement of high-profile targets and the potential for miscalculations raise the risk of broader regional destabilization.",

      "Iran may escalate attacks on US allies and civilian infrastructure in the Gulf region.",
      "US and Israeli forces could intensify strikes on Iranian leadership and critical infrastructure.",
      "The involvement of additional regional actors, such as Hezbollah or other Iranian proxies, could expand the conflict's geographic scope."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would likely require urgent diplomatic intervention from global powers, including China, Russia, and European states, to mediate a ceasefire and initiate negotiations. However, given the current trajectory and the absence of clear diplomatic initiatives, the prospects for immediate de-escalation appear limited. A potential leadership vacuum within Iran could also complicate efforts to reach a negotiated settlement."
