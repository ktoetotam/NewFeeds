  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating with further direct military engagements between Iran and the US-Israel alliance. Iran is expected to maintain its retaliatory strikes on US bases and regional allies, while the US and Israel may intensify their campaign with additional airstrikes and special operations. The risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation remains high, particularly with the involvement of non-state actors and the potential for expanded targeting of civilian infrastructure.",

      "Iranian attacks on civilian targets in Gulf states allied with the US.",
      "Escalation of proxy warfare in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen by Iran-backed militias.",
      "Potential use of chemical, biological, or cyber weapons by either side."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially involving key regional actors like Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, as well as international bodies such as the UN. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with confidence-building measures and the resumption of nuclear talks, could provide a framework for de-escalation. However, given the current trajectory and the deep-seated hostilities, such an outcome appears increasingly challenging without significant external pressure and incentives."
