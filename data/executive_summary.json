  },
  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US-Israel alliance sustaining direct military engagements. Iran's demonstrated capability to strike US assets and allies suggests further regional destabilization, while US retaliatory strikes could expand the conflict's geographic scope. The involvement of proxy groups and the potential for miscalculations raise the risk of broader regional warfare.",

      "Potential involvement of additional regional actors, such as Turkey or Russia, due to escalating instability."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require diplomatic intervention from major powers, including China, Russia, and European states, alongside urgent negotiations facilitated by the UN. A ceasefire agreement, potentially involving the release of hostages or commitments to limit strikes on civilian targets, could pave the way for dialogue. However, given the current trajectory, such pathways appear increasingly challenging without a significant shift in strategic objectives by both Iran and the US."
