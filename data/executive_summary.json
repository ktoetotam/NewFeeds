  "executive_summary": "The Iran-US conflict has escalated to MAJOR (Level 1/5, Score 2396) with 396 incidents in the last 24 hours. A coordinated US-Israeli airstrike on Iran on Feb 28 killed Supreme Leader Khamenei, triggering massive Iranian retaliation including ballistic missile barrages on Israel and strikes on 14+ US bases across Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states. Iranian forces have also targeted civilian infrastructure in Dubai and Tel Aviv. The conflict has expanded beyond traditional military targets to include civilian areas, with over 100 casualties reported in a school strike in southern Iran.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to intensify over the next 24-72 hours. Iran has announced 'more severe retaliatory measures' following Khamenei's reported death, and IRGC proxies (Hezbollah, Houthis) are mobilizing. US and Israel have demonstrated willingness to conduct sustained bombing campaigns (1,200+ bombs). Without diplomatic intervention, the conflict will likely expand geographically with additional Iranian strikes on Gulf states and US allies. Civilian infrastructure targeting may increase as both sides escalate.",

      "Anti-US protests spreading in Pakistan and potentially other Muslim-majority nations"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "UN Secretary-General has expressed regret over diplomacy failure and warned of 'uncontrollable escalation.' Immediate ceasefire requires third-party mediation (UN, Russia, China) and direct US-Iran communication channels. However, with Khamenei's death, Iran's hardliners may demand continued escalation rather than negotiation. The 40-day mourning period declared by Iran could provide a temporary window for diplomatic engagement, though IRGC statements suggest military operations will continue regardless."
