  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US engaging in retaliatory strikes. The involvement of regional proxies and the deployment of advanced weaponry, such as hypersonic missiles, increase the risk of further direct military engagements. The international community's efforts to de-escalate the situation are unlikely to succeed in the short term given the current trajectory of hostilities.",
    "escalation_risks": [
      "Direct military confrontation between US and Iranian forces could expand to other theaters, such as the Persian Gulf or Syria.",
      "The use of advanced weaponry, including ballistic missiles and hypersonic missiles, raises the risk of miscalculation and unintended escalation.",
      "The potential elimination of Iran's Supreme Leader could lead to internal power struggles and further destabilize the region."
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require a coordinated diplomatic effort involving key regional and global powers, potentially under the auspices of the UN or a neutral mediator. Immediate steps could include a ceasefire agreement, followed by negotiations on regional security arrangements and Iran's nuclear program. However, given the current hostilities and lack of trust between the parties, such an outcome appears unlikely without significant external pressure."
