  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to intensify with further direct military engagements between Iran, the US, and Israel.

    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation could be pursued through urgent diplomatic intervention by major powers such as China, Russia, and European states. A UN-brokered ceasefire or regional peace conference might offer a path to negotiations, but given the current hostilities and lack of trust between parties, this remains challenging. Third-party mediation and confidence-building measures, such as humanitarian pauses, could help reduce tensions."
