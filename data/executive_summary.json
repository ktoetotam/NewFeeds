    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both the US and Iran demonstrating a willingness to engage in direct military action.

    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation may depend on international diplomatic efforts, particularly through the UN Security Council and key regional actors such as Russia and China. The involvement of third-party mediators and the potential for a ceasefire agreement could offer pathways to reduce hostilities, but this requires a commitment from both the US and Iran to engage in negotiations."
