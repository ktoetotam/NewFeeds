    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially through a UN-led initiative or direct negotiations between the US and Iran. Regional powers such as Qatar, Russia, and France could play a mediating role. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with assurances on Iran's nuclear program and regional security, might offer a path to de-escalation, though the current climate of hostility makes this challenging."
