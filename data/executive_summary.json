  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US armed conflict has reached an unprecedented level of escalation as of 28 February 2026. A coordinated US-Israeli preventive strike targeted Iranian leadership and IRGC infrastructure across over 20 provinces, reportedly killing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and dozens of senior officials. Iran responded with massive retaliatory strikes across the region, launching ballistic missiles at Israel and hitting at least 14 US military bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Gulf states. The conflict now directly involves five nations with active hostilities across maritime, air, and ground domains. Threat level remains MAJOR with 319 incidents in 24 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to continue escalating over the next 24-72 hours. With Iran's Supreme Leader confirmed dead and the IRGC launching multiple retaliation waves, Iran will likely pursue additional strikes on Israel and remaining US bases. The IRGC has announced attacks on 27 US bases, suggesting sustained campaign. Israel's claim of destroying Iranian naval assets and leadership decapitation may degrade Iranian response capacity, but IRGC's decentralized command structure allows continued operations. US allies (Gulf states) are now directly targeted, solidifying their alignment with US-Israeli position. Risk of Israeli expansion into Lebanon (Hezbollah) remains high if Iranian proxies intensify.",
