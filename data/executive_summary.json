    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require a combination of diplomatic engagement and mutual restraint. Key pathways could include back-channel negotiations, third-party mediation (e.g., by France or the UN), and confidence-building measures such as temporary ceasefires or humanitarian corridors. However, given the current trajectory and severity of hostilities, these pathways appear challenging to implement without a significant shift in strategic objectives or leadership directives."
