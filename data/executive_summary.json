  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has reached a critical inflection point with the confirmed death of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in a US-Israeli coordinated strike, triggering Iran's declaration of 40 days national mourning. The conflict has expanded dramatically: Iran has launched ballistic missiles at Israel and struck 14 US bases across Iraq, Syria, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. US B-2 stealth bombers are now being deployed. The IRGC claims 200 US casualties and continues maritime attacks. All Gulf states are now directly engaged, with the UAE issuing emergency alerts to residents. Threat level remains MAJOR with 259 incidents in 24 hours.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to intensify significantly over the next 24-72 hours. With Khamenei dead and Iran in a 40-day mourning period, the IRGC will likely consolidate power and authorize continued mass-casualty strikes against US assets and Israel. B-2 bomber deployment signals the US is preparing for extended precision strike campaigns against Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. The 14-base Iranian strike demonstrates capacity for sustained multi-theater attacks. Gulf states — now directly targeted — will likely increase cooperation with US-Israeli operations, potentially providing bases and intelligence. Regional escalation trajectory is HIGH.",

      "Gulf state involvement draws regional powers into direct warfare — Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt may be drawn in"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation pathways are severely constrained. The death of Khamenei removes the supreme authority needed for any negotiated settlement. However, limited pathways exist: (1) IRGC internal power struggle could create a faction willing to negotiate — currently suppressed; (2) Total collapse of Iranian military capacity through sustained B-2 bombing could force capitulation — but risks nuclear escalation; (3) UN-mediated ceasefire possible but rejected by both sides — Iran claims right to self-defense, US/Israel show no willingness to stop; (4) Gulf state pressure on US to limit strikes — Saudi Arabia privately supported attack but will seek to prevent total regional collapse. Most likely: sustained conflict for minimum 2-4 weeks until one side's capacity is degraded below threshold for continued operations."
