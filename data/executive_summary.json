    "base_case": "The conflict is expected to continue escalating, with further direct military engagements between Iran, the US, and Israel. Retaliatory attacks by Iran and its proxies against US assets and regional allies are likely, deepening the crisis and increasing the risk of broader regional conflict.

    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require urgent diplomatic intervention, potentially involving neutral actors such as Oman or international bodies like the UN. A ceasefire agreement, coupled with assurances from the US and Israel regarding further military action, could pave the way for negotiations. However, given the current trajectory and mutual hostility, such pathways appear challenging without significant external pressure and concessions from both sides."
