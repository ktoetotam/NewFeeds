  "executive_summary": "The Iran–US conflict has escalated to full-scale regional war with both sides exchanging mass casualty strikes. US and Israeli forces launched coordinated attacks on 20+ Iranian provinces, targeting IRGC infrastructure and allegedly killing Supreme Leader Khamenei. Iran has responded with ballistic missile barrages against Israel and strikes on 14+ US bases across Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar. The 6h window shows 130 incidents at MAJOR severity level, with IRGC claiming 200 US personnel killed and civilian casualties exceeding 100 in school strikes. The conflict now directly involves Gulf Arab states and threatens to expand further.",

  "outlook_24_72h": {
    "base_case": "The conflict trajectory indicates continued escalation over the next 24-72 hours. Iran's military has been fully mobilized and IRGC has announced 'more severe retaliatory measures' pending. With Supreme Leader Khamenei reportedly killed (unverified), leadership succession may either trigger moderation or intensify hardline response. The Houthis have pledged full support to Iran and will likely expand operations against Saudi Arabia and UAE. US forces across 14+ bases have been struck, creating strong pressure for major retaliation. The 6h incident rate (130 events) suggests intense ongoing combat with no de-escalation signals.",

      "Israel announces expanded strikes on Tehran — urban warfare escalation"
    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "No immediate de-escalation pathways identified. UN Secretary-General has urged all parties to 'see reason' but diplomatic channels appear severed. Iran's leadership transition (if Khamenei confirmed dead) creates potential negotiating window but IRGC appears committed to continued hostilities. The Assembly of Experts must appoint successor — this 40-day process may delay strategic decisions. International pressure (UN, IAEA emergency meeting) may create space for negotiated ceasefire but current military momentum favors continued escalation."
