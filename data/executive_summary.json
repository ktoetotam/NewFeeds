    "base_case": "The conflict is likely to continue escalating, with both Iran and the US-Israel alliance expanding their military operations.

    ],
    "de_escalation_pathways": "De-escalation would require concerted diplomatic efforts, potentially involving international mediators such as the UN or key global powers like China and Russia. Immediate steps could include ceasefire negotiations, confidence-building measures, and the establishment of communication channels to prevent accidental escalation. However, given the current intensity of hostilities and the absence of clear diplomatic initiatives, the likelihood of near-term de-escalation appears low."
